    /**     * This method finds the nonce (between 0 and maxNonce) that provides the lowest difficulty score. 
     * Used only for mining, lower difficulty scores are better. Peers do not need to run this when confirming certificates. 
     * When a peer checks a certificate for mining rights, it simply checks the nonce provided by a peer. 
     * Theoretically, a certificate could have several nonces which solve a block.  
     * Performance is more than adequate for intended purpose. Anyone suggesting I multithread this will be ignored.  
     * As this is only called by the miner once, and then never used again for a given certificate, it just has to work well. 
     * On one core of an i7-3770K clocked at 3.9GHz, this can perform approximately 647,249 nonce checks per second. YMMV. 
     * Using FAH as an example, say a WU was worth 30,000 'points' and for each point, FAH gave you one nonce in the certificate. 
     * That seems reasonable. 
     * So this method would take 0.04635 seconds on a high-end desktop. You ran a GPU for 6 hours to finish that WU. 
     * You can afford to wait 0.04635 seconds to check to see if you earned any coins. :) 
     * Originally, the certificate used for mining was going to have the signature used in the hash. 
     * However, this provides no additional security (transitive property; if the signature matches the message and the message  
     * when a nonce is appended hashes to below the difficulty, it is a legitimate address.) and was removed for performance 
     * considerations. Hashing that much data unnecessarily was decided to be a terrible idea. 
     *  
     * Here's how difficulty works: the 'difficulty' grows higher as more people do more computational science per second. 
     * A nonce's hash score has to be under a 'target' in order to mine a block. 
     * Therefore, as the difficulty grows, the target shrinks. The target is Long.MAX_VALUE / (difficulty/2). The /2 accounts 
     * for half of the numbers being negative.  
     *  
     * At a difficulty of 10, 1/10 nonces will be a solution. At a difficulty of 100, 1/100 nonces will be a solution. 
     * At a difficulty of 1000, 1/1000 nonces will be a solution. You may notice a pattern.

                 * and still work perfectly fine. That being said, my method seems simple. I take the first 8 bytes of the hash, and turn that into a number. 
                 * Let's review binary: 
                 * {binary = decimal} 
                 * 1 = 1 
                 * 10 = 2

                 * 01111 = 15 
                 * 10111 = 17 
                 * Cool. So you'll notice that the number is bigger for two same-length pieces of binary when the first digit is a zero.  
                 * This means the most sigificant bit is the left-most-bit. 
                 * The above are examples of UNSIGNED conversion. 
                 * Cause negative numbers are occasionally useful, Java's Long is signed. That means the first bit dictates whether the number is positive or negative. 
                 * In what might appear counter-intuitive at first, if the first digit is a 1, the long is negative. If it is a 0, the long is positive. 
                 * As a result, the largest possible unsigned values will start with a 1 as that signed bit position (left-most-bit) normally represents 2^63 on its own.  
                 * Since a hash can be simplified as a mental exercise to spit out 'random' or unpredictable data which has no propensity towards any patterns, this first 
                 * bit has a 50 percent chance every hash to be a 1. If it's a 1, it's a huge number anyway (2^63 plus change).  
                 * As a result, there's no reason to even care about any negative longs, as they actually represent the biggest numbers (if longs were unsigned). 
                 *  
                 * 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 is actually a negative number when converted, because a long is signed. 
                 * If tempDiff is negative, it means its most significant bit is a 1, so if it wasn't signed, it would be huge. 
                 * For this reason, it's incredibly safe to discard all negative numbers. If the Curecoin network difficulty is so easy that a Long represented in binary 
                 * starting with a 1 can solve it, I'll start folding on a raspberry pie and fix it. There would have to be, on average, only one certificate per three 
                 * minutes, with only ONE allowed nonce (0) for the difficulty to drop this low. Aka Curecoin would have to be abandoned. By everyone. At the same time. 
                 * In that event, allowing the block time to slip to 6 minutes (the result of discarding a potential solution to the minimum difficulty 50 percent of the 
                 * time) probably isn't my biggest concern.
