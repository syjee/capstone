/** * Only one Blockchain object is created per instance of the daemon. It keeps track of ALL possible chains, and internally handles chain reorganization. 
* The decision to put LedgerManager as an object owned by Blockchain was for purposes of simplicity--there's only one Blockchain, and only one LedgerManager. 
* The Blockchain has fork management integrated, and should be able to appropriately handle any unexpected circumstances. Fork management is one of 
* the major things I'm watching for during 2.0.0a1. If you want to try to fork the network, please do. I'm sure there are ways. 
*  
* As the blockchain has the most up-to-date information about blockchain data, it makes perfect sense for the ledger, which is based purely on the blockchain, 
* to be managed by the Blockchain object. Initial plans were to have separate Blockchain objects for each fork in a chainbut the overhead of cloning Blockchain 
* objects seemed unwarranted. Significant optimization still needs to be done on the fork management--climbing all the way down the shorter chain and back up 
* the longer chain is NOT a permanant solution, and I hope to have respectable fork management overhead by 2.0.0a2.  
*  
* Additionally, there is no need to store identical blocks between multiple forks. The overhead of a fork suddenly requiring double the blockchain storage is 
* unacceptable. It works, I think. But unacceptable for production code, so that'll certainly change, hopefully by 2.0.0a2 or 2.0.0a3, depending on my schedule. 
*  
* As blocks are added to the blockchain, the ledger is updated. While working beautifully in small-scale testing, I'm sure the signature count synchronization 
* between signed transactions and blocks will trip up at some point, and send the Blockchain object into either a loop of dispair, or an irrecoverable error. 
* Either is equally frightening.  
*  
* Fault tolerance with desynchronization between ledger and blockchain for signature accounts will be a 2.0.0a3 or 2.0.0a4 feature. I've gotta think long and  
* hard about the best approaches that don't compromise security in the name of fault-tolerance, while remaining usable, reliable, and fast.  
*  
* You'll notice a loop which appears to retry transactions up to 10,000 times. Transactions must be executed in order--two transactions from the same address 
* need to go in order of signature index, otherwise the storage space required to maintain all used signature indexes would be astronomical. 
*  
* As a caveat to the Merkle Tree signature scheme, Lamport Key reuse creates the potential for double-spend attacks, so once a Lamport Keypair is used, the network 
* rejects all future signatures from that keypair. Important to keep this in mind--
